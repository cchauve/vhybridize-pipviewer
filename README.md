Virtual Hybridization
=====================

This package contains Virtual Hybridization tools.  Virtual
Hybridization uses sets of short probes to generate datasets for
comparative genomics: given a DNA sequence and a set of probes, the
typical output will give a sequence of oriented probe hits along the
DNA sequence. Other tools are supplied to allow simple manipulations
such as format conversion and extraction of permutations.


Pip Viewer
==========

Pipviewer is a visualizer for multiple alignements of genomic
sequences.  It highlights conserved regions and allows basic
anotations.  Its main goal is to find conserved probes for the
construction of gene order data sets.  Selected regions marked as
'probes' can be expoxted to fasta format.  It can also retreive gene
annotations form the NBCI and display this information along the
alignement.
